This is Dijkstra's algorithm. The only modification is the variable that keeps track of the edges, but because this is addition, it is a constant function and will not affect the work or span. This means that the work and span of shortest_shortest_path are equal to the work and span of Dijkstra's algorithm. So, the total work and span is O(|E|log|E|), where |E| is the number of edges in the graph.
